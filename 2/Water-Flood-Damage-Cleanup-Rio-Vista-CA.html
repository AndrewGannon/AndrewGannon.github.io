<p>Whether a storm soaked your floorings with 2 feet of floodwaters, you left your bath tub faucet running, your pipes burst, or a fire left you with a house loaded with water, you have water damage and you need to take immediate action.

<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - drywall, carpet, or furnishings - has been warmed to its unique ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger enduring damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most obvious, and damaging, item of this chemical reaction.

If not, you may need to change the whole drywall panel.</p>
