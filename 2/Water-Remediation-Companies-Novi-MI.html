<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a household or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
