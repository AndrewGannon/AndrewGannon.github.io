<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a family or company can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
