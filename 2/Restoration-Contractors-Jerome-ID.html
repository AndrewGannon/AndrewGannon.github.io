<h3>Fire And Restoration in Jerome</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and need to be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
