<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
