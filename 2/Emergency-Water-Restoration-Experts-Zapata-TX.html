Warm air between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is perfect, specifically for the first 36 to 2 days of drying and is the ideal temperature for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Overly hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hinders the dehumidifiers' effectiveness.<p>
<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it might unintentionally press liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was entirely submerged. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is imperative to prevent recontamination. You must seal and right away deal with products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the shoes or boots you used while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
