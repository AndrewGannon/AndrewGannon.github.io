<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that clean it away with a moist towel. As with a few of the above techniques, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any hard surface areas to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be eliminated, such as furniture, clothing, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are gotten rid of, typically including deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
