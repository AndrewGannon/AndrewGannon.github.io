<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
