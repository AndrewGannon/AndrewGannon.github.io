It may be dirt that can be simply power-washed off, or it might be mold. You shouldn't have anything growing, or perhaps creating an inviting environment, for animals, bugs, or birds. If the plants and animals of your area decides to settle in on your roofing system, it's going to begin to use and break down faster.

<p>Since common building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
