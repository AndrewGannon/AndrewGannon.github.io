<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand just how much new wallboard you need. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, utilizing an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and then secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power motorist. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel satisfies. Then use joint compound over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the manufacturer and after that sand the compound with fine-grit sandpaper until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
