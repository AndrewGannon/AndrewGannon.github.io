While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be.

Due to the fact that of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this location is generally less extreme, so cleaning and getting rid of impacted areas is often adequate.</p>
