<p>Mold assessments search for evidence of mold or mildew growth which indicates a water or moisture issue. They can include mold growth around vents, on walls or baseboards, even in your HVAC ductwork! Because the source of mold development can often be concealed, it is a great idea to employ a mold specialist who knows where to look and has the devices to assess your scenario.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every single two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
