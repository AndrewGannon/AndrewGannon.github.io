<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily. This could aggravate the problem because as you understand - mold likes damp environments.<p>
