<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier because it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to finish.<p>
