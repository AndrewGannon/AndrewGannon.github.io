<p>Rust is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and steady deterioration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration happens when you integrate electricity, oxygen, water and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no reputable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components usually start wearing away instantly after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of an issue. How fast the rust process takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
