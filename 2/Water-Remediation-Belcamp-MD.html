These conditions can help in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and practical energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
