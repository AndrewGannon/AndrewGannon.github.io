<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly.

<h3>Why You Should Hire Millstadt Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
<p>Dry completely and quickly. If the energies are on, use the air conditioning or heating system, fans, and a dehumidifier or desiccants to speed drying.
