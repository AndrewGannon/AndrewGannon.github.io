<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and remove the battery instantly. Getting rid of the battery rapidly might make the difference to conserve your phone. Many phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has actually damaged the device.

You can likewise attempt to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too close to the gadget. Often cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water very long.</p>
