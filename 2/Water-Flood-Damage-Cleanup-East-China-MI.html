<p>Rust is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow deterioration of products (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you combine electrical power, oxygen, metal and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reputable timetable for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal components generally begin corroding instantly after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How quickly the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
