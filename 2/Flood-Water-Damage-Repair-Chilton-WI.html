<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a combination that lawyers now declare came from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little government and builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much higher.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every single two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
