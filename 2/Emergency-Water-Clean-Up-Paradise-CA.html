<p>Indoor mold development can typically be seen or smelled. In most cases, if noticeable mold growth is present, tasting is not needed. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can utilize to examine a mold tasting outcome. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold testing or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what kind of mold might be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be costly and, if done, ought to only be done by knowledgeable experts. Examine a mold problem; don't test</p>
<p>Because mold and mildew can be a severe health risk, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be removed to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach since it is safe to use and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave harmful residue or produce hazardous fumes like chlorine bleach does.
