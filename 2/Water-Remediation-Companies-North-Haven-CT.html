<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall products generally do not dry very well, so if your walls are soaked, it's typically best to rip them out to prevent mold, especially if they aren't completely dry within 2 days. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on tough non-porous surfaces such as counter tops, glass or tiles however it is inefficient at eliminating mold growing in porous material such as wood or drywall.<p>
