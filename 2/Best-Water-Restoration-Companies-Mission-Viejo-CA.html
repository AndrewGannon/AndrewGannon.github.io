<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can take place on its own if a fire is included. A number of hundred lawsuits filed in the last 5 years allege that most of these houses contain dozens of violations of the state-mandated building code that eventually enabled water to drain pipes into both brand-new and remodelled houses. Many homes with water damage absence fundamental weatherproofing materials, inspection reports state. Coats of stucco are frequently too thin.

<p>Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and must be removed.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, duct work and electrical wiring.</p>
<p>In some cases water flows unseen down the within wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall.
