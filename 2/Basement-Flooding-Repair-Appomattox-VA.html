<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide.
