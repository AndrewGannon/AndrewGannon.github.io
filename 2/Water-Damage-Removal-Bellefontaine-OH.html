<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
