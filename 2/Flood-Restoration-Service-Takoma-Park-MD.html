<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually impacted your valuables, we will work with you and your insurer to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which permeates into permeable surface area, avoiding water from permeating back through. Basically, it makes the location strong once again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>
