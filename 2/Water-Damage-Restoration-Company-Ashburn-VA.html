<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

We get to work quicker and start extracting water rapidly to start drying your residential or commercial property with our state of the art equipment.

<p>These factors influence the movement of wetness within a product along with the evaporation rate from the surface of the product and can greatly impact the total drying. time for a task. It is important to quickly control the wetness in the air and use enough airflow to dry the surface area of products to lower water activity, thus lowering the capacity for microbial development. If the surfaces of hygroscopic materials can be dried and maintained below 0.75, microbial growth can be rapidly stopped, even though the core of the material may still have raised moisture material.</p>
<p>Food sources for mold in structures include cellulose-based materials such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and raw material such as soap, materials, and dust containing skin cells. If a home has mold, the wetness might come from the basement or crawl area, a dripping roofing or a leakage in plumbing pipelines. Insufficient ventilation may speed up moisture accumulation. Noticeable mold nests may form where ventilation is poorest and on border walls (due to the fact that they are nearest the humidity ).</p>
<p>Examination reports and suits by seven neighbors on the block now declare that building and construction defects enabled water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test showed that some parts of their wall had actually likely decomposed and developed mold. Paper suggested to line the roofing, instead of the kind needed by the building code, was utilized on the walls. At Jackson's, the stucco was not sufficiently sealed around some pipes, an inspector stated, permitting water to trickle in and travel through her walls.</p>
