<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
