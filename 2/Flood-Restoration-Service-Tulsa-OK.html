One product we use is MMR, a commercial grade tool that gets deep underneath the external layer to destroy mold. Additionally, we deal with the spots often triggered by a mold growth.

MMR helps Mold Solutions NW address stain issues as well as mold growth by getting under the surface on affected areas.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When wet incoming air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process soaks up wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily run listed below freezing temperature levels.</p>
