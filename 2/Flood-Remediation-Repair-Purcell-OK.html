<p>Indoor mold development can usually be seen or smelled. In most cases, if noticeable mold development exists, sampling is not required. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can utilize to examine a mold sampling result. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold screening or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what kind of mold might be growing.

<p>Drywall is really a panel of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched in between two types of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer).

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for every two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
