<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold is a common offender of damage in many of our organisations and homes here in Central Illinois. Mold spores can spread out rapidly when wetness exists.
