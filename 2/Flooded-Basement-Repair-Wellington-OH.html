<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often two times a day) to monitor and change the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and likewise were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>What to do when your house floods and you are stuck wondering how to cleanup concrete basement floor after a flood? If your basement is nearly complete or complete of water, drain just 2 or 3 feet (0.91 m) of water each day.

<p>Because big pieces of drywall require to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas larger than 12 square inches may need a complete replacement panel installed.
