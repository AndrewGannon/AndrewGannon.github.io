<p>We work and live in this neighborhood too; we may even be neighbors. As an in your area owned and operated business, SERVPRO of Clay County is nearby and all set to assist with your mold-damaged home.

<p>The primary top priority will always be to avoid damage from getting even worse when restoration begins in earnest. For example, a hole burned in an outside wall or your roofing would receive immediate attention. Fire damage restoration also frequently works together with water damage restoration If the fire has actually damaged a pipeline or water tank, it's essential to stop the water damage prior to it spreads.<p>
<p>When the property is dry, we will clean the soot from surface areas, such as ceilings, items, walls, and floors using specialized equipment. The restoration group will likewise eliminate chemical and biological pollutants. Removing smoke odors is accomplished with devices such as foggers, ozone generators, and hydroxyl generators. Assessing mold development includes more than just taking a look at what's visibly growing on the walls or in a corner. Mold can be an invisible trespasser, growing behind and around what you first see. Such devious behavior needs analytical thinking.<p>
<p>After scrubbing the surface areas, allow the bleach option to continue to permeate the surfaces and dry. Getting an area dry needs removing the wetness not just from the affected products but also from the air. Fans will blow air throughout the surface area and trigger the water to vaporize, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it will not kick back into the product and trigger additional damage to the room.<p>
