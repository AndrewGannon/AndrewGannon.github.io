<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a big brush, and bear in mind that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be removed and replaced.

Never ever scrape dried mold, or else the harmful spores could spread into air and trigger negative health impacts.</p>

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always convenient. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth discovering.

At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
