<p>Flooding can cause severe damage to an industrial structure. Whether it's caused by heavy rain, overflowing waterways, or damaged pipes, the water needs to be gotten rid of and the building's contents need to be rapidly dried to avoid structural damage, mold development, and other problems.

However you can manage mold growth by keeping your home dry.<p>
