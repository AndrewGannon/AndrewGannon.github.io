<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As mentioned, quick air motion throughout wet surfaces of assemblies or materials is an important element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Quick air motion throughout the surface area of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface moisture paves the way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying products need various requirements for changing conditions.</p>

Should you choose to utilize bleach or another chemical, please read and thoroughly follow the label directions and hazard statements (care, caution, risk).
