<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling rural houses, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with products other than stucco had issues, too. Some houses with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local firms. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
