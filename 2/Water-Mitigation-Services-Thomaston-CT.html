If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really costly paperweight.</p>
