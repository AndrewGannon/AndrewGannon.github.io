<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold remediation should not just kill an existing development, but also make sure mold doesn't find a way to come back. Our 10-year guarantee guarantees that the EPA-registered anti-microbial we utilize will keep mold from growing back after it is gotten rid of.

We enter into more information about our avoidance methods listed below. At Mold Solutions NW, we do not just wish to get rid of mold - we don't desire it to ever grow back.</p>
