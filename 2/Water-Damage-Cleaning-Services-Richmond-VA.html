It differs in color and type, and is generally found in locations that have been subjected to moisture at some point in time, such as restrooms or in locations around leaking pipelines. Prior to you start a job like this, offer the water damaged location a great clean. This is the textbook first step in any paint project, consisting of fixing water damage on walls. We recommend utilizing something like a Selleys Sugar Soap with a damp fabric and after that allowing time for the area to dry.<p>
