<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour.
