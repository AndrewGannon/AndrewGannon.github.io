<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, however it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to finish.<p>
