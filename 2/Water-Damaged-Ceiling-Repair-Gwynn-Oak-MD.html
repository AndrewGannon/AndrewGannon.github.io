<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier removes water vapor from the air using a process called condensation. LGR dehumidifiers continue to get rid of a significant amount of water vapor below 40 grains per pound. Since they are much more energy effective and they can pull the grains down much lower, lgrs are a distinct form of residential and commercial grade refrigerant dehumidifiers. LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or enhanced action to reduce the moisture-laden air temperature level when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
<p>After you learn how to eliminate mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling wetness is the key to stopping most mold. The worst infestations typically happen in damp crawl spaces, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with poor structure drainage. Stopping leaks, making sure excellent ventilation in attics, keeping crawl spaces dry and routing water away from the foundation are the very best defenses versus mold.</p>
