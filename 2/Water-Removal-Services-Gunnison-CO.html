Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
