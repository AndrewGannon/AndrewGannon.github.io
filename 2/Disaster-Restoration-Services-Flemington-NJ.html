Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
