Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
