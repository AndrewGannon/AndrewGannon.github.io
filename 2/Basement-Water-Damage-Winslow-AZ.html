Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
