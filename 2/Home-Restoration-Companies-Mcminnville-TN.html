<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
