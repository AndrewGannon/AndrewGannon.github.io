Even worse, it can be bad for your health. Mold releases microscopic spores that trigger allergies, runny noses and sneezing, along with even harmful and irritating odors.

<p>If it has actually not spread out far and wide, eliminating mold from wood is simple. Before beginning, put on your protective wear, specifically a mask and gloves. Initially, vacuum up the area with the mold. This will draw up any loose spores on the surface area of the wood. Next, scrub the area with soap and water. On bare, unpainted or untreated wood, you can use bleach. Soak up any cleaner and additional wetness.<p>
