If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
