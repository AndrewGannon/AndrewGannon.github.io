<h3>Basement Flooding in Bucyrus Ohio</h2>
<p>If there are dark areas on your ceiling, floorings or walls, this is a sure indication of mold growth. Moldy smells and mildew are often signs that mold may be growing in your home. Respiratory and allergy signs such as coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and wheezing are a typical sign of mold growth also.

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the damp desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. Desiccant dehumidifiers work when wet incoming air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant. This process takes in wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily run listed below freezing temperatures.</p>
