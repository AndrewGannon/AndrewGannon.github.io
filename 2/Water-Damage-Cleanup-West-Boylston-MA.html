Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged expert on the biological elements of air pollution, this group was assigned to validate and evaluate the brand-new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors.

So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to assist ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings must be included in the drying record to consist of air, a/c, and devices systems. Wetness content levels for damp structural materials must be taped in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These recorded wetness content readings will reveal that the building is back to an appropriate series of pre-loss condition. It is very important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are required.</p>
