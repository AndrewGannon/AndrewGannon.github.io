<p>It is very important to eliminate all moisture ASAP prior to it causes more damage. And for little leakages, this might not be difficult, but it is necessary to be thorough.

<p>Also, given that bleach is primarily water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily absorbed by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or stained the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact offered a lot of water to regrow and potentially spread the mold underneath the surface area. If there is a great deal of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other assistance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
