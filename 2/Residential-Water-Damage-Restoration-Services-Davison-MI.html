<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground.

An unique HEPA vacuum ensures that even tiny particles get gathered to minimize the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make doubly sure that mold does not discover a way out of the included work area and into a various part of the structure.</p>
