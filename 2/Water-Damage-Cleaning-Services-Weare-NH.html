<p>One reason is that bleach can not entirely eliminate mold growing in porous materials. The chlorine in bleach can not permeate into permeable surface areas such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface of porous materials and just the water component of the bleach is absorbed into the material, providing more moisture for the mold to feed on.

Usually, repair work include the replacement of products, painting, and any other repair services that will be required to bring back the home or service to its pre-loss condition.<p>
