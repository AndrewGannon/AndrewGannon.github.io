<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
