Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
