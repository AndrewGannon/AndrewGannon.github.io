<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
