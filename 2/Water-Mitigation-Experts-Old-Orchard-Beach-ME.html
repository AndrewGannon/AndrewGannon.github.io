<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air movement throughout wet surfaces of materials or assemblies is a crucial element of successfully and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Fast air motion throughout the surface of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness paves the way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
