<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done properly.
