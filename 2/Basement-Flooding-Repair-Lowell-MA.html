<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
