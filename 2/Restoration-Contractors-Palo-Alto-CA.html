<p>Last but not least, we wish to resolve the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical sensitivities especially if utilized in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at getting rid of mold than a damp cloth and a moderate detergent, so we suggest the least poisonous alternative.</p>
