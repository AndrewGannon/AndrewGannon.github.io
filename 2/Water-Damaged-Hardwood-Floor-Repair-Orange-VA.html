There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>

<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Orange</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and ought to be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
