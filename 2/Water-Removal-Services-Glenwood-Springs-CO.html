When they and others grumbled, AGA sent out a professional to re-caulk windows-- however the leaks continued. The professional returned. The leaks grew even worse.<p>
<p>We log the moisture and determine content of materials, and screen and log progress so we know the real drying time and guarantee restoration to the suitable dry standard. First of all, the restoration specialists examine the property and examine the level of the soot, fire, and smoke damage.

<p>Clean it: Mold is remediated using antimicrobial and biocide agents that are sprayed to suspend or eliminate any microorganisms. Permeable products like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and fabric are usually removed. Semi-Porous non-Removable materials like wood and concrete can be cleaned with HEPA vacuum, abrasive sanding and hand cleaning. Our technicians will then push clean all affected non-porous and semi-porous structure materials, such as wood, tile, and cement.
