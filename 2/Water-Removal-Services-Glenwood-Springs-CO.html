When they and others grumbled, AGA sent out a professional to re-caulk windows-- however the leaks continued. The professional returned. The leaks grew even worse.<p>
<p>We log the moisture and determine content of materials, and screen and log progress so we know the real drying time and guarantee restoration to the suitable dry standard.

<p>Clean it: Mold is remediated using antimicrobial and biocide agents that are sprayed to suspend or eliminate any microorganisms. Permeable products like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and fabric are usually removed.
