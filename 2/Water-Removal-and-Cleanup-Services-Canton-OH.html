<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the space you're fixing so that you understand just how much brand-new wallboard you need. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and after that secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel meets. Then apply joint compound over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the producer and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
