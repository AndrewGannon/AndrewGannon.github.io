<h3>Carpet Cleaning Water Damage in Brewster Massachusetts</h2>
<p>There are 3 basic steps to the water damage restoration process. The primary step is to get rid of all of the water from the affected property. That implies correcting any pipes problems, fixing any problems that could be causing condensation, or awaiting the floodwaters to recede, depending on the circumstances. After the issue has been remedied, the property then needs to be completely dried, removing all traces of wetness.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a severe health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

And several homeowners said they think new health issues stem from what's taking place behind their walls.</p>
