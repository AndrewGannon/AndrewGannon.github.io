<p>Safeguard Non-Damaged Areas- When containment barriers are set up we will begin removing the damp dry wall and start to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which enables the carpet to dry. We will also move furnishings out of the wet locations to insure that all excess wetness inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold issues occur later.<p>
<p>Temperature Control - Through this final step we use the concepts of psychrometry, ensuring that all wetness once eliminated is not put back into the structure, thus lowering the chance of mold and mildew development.
