<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be eliminated if soaked by polluted floodwater.

This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
