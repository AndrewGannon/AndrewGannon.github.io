<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most destructive things that can occur to a person or a household. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being completely replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require repairing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The sort of wood floor covering you might have determines and limits the type of repairs that require to happen. Solid hardwood flooring permits a larger range of alternatives to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for specific slabs. The best way to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
