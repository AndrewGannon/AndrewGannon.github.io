<p>When you are preparing big repair work, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges.

This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
