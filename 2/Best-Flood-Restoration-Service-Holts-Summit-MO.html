For long-lasting concerns, like mold caused by attic condensation, the mold may have begun growing a long time back. And if you find mold and mildew problems, you require to be very careful.

<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and ought to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.
