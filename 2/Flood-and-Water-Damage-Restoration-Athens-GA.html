<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Use a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore protection, and cover hands, arms and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will lower the occurrence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any nearby locations. Make sure it will not stain the product or surface if you utilize bleach. Place all sponges, devices and other materials used in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a close-by exit rather than the primary home, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>

When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.
