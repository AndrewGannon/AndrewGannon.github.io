<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
