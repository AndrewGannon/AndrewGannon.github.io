<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists normally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall.
