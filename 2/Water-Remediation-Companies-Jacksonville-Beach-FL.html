Repair any leaks or underlying concerns right now to help prevent mold growth or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and outside of your home. Therefore, it is not possible to completely get rid of" all of the mold from within a structure, as tiny spores will still exist even after the issue has actually been attended to.<p>

Most mold removal (remediation) takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Water damaged carpeting and drywall will naturally dry. Even more, real time drying helps to immediately adjust fan speed, defrost cycles, and more to help accelerate drying times in differing conditions and structures.<p>
