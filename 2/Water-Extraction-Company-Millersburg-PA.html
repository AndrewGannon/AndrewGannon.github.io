<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is wet and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores.

<p>Water damage can be the starting point for lots of severe issues that can affect a structure, damage personal property and present major health risks to occupants.
