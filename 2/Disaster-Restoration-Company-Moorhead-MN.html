<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
