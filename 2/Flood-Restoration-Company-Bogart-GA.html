<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Bogart</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and should be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not kill mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, employees and others out of the affected location. Attempting to dry the location with a fan might interrupt the spores and spread them to a new area. Eliminating black mold is a step-by-step procedure that requires patience, an investment in protective gear and black mold removal items, and, of course, the nerve to brave dark, confined spaces inhabited by toxic fungi.<p>
