<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Powell</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and must be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>It only takes a little water leakage, and even excess humidity, for mold to form in your Bend home or company. Then, mold can spread out rapidly through the home in as little as two days. Mold can produce allergens and irritants, and it has the potential to cause other health impacts. We can inspect and assess your residential or commercial property and utilize our specialized equipment, training, and competence to remediate your mold problem if your home or organisation has a mold problem.<p>
