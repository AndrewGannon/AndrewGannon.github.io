These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
