<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of home damage that a family or business can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>
