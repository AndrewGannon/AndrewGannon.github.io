<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Drooping or moldy walls. Any significant sagging in parts of the walls or ceiling is a sign that you require water damage repair services. Drywall 1 droops when filled with water. Seeing visible mold on the walls is another indication, however not everybody notifications mold within their houses. Before mold is located, you may smell a distinct moldy aroma or experience allergy signs due to mold exposure. These smells are especially pungent in locations like the basement. The foul odor is similar to the scent of damp, musty laundry. Unfortunately, it's not unusual for property owners to mistake mold development for dirt.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air.
