<p>One day, I got back from work thinking I 'd have the ability to unwind. Instead, I came within to rain putting below the cooking area ceiling because my child left on the restroom faucet all day (9+ hours).

<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes.</p>
