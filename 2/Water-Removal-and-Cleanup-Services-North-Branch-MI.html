<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air till they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
