<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
