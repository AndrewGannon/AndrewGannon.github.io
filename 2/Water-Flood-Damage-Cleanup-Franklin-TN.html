<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, offered the nature of basements - they tend to be far more humid than above-ground levels and typically have bad ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can trigger mold to flourish.

These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of numerous days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
