Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable signs of moisture, dripping water, or indications of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or fall apart under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous plaster material. Other times, you may notice small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand gradually.</p>
<p>Cleanup: Throughout the cleaning and restoration phase of the task, your trained cleanup group will utilize the suitable mix of cleaning agents, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers.

Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned are very first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and ventilating agent. These multiple actions are required to ensure walls and ceilings are clean and that residual smell has been eliminated.</p>
