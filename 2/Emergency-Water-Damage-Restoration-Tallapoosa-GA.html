<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. During a water loss emergency, almost every location of your Seattle home could be at danger for damage. Migrating water and moisture can penetrate permeable surface areas and contents, which can modify their look and cause irreparable damage within the very first 48 hours of direct exposure.

<p>Because common structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
