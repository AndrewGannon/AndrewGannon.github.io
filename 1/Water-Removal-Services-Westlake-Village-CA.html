As soon as MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
