<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Fridges, hot water heater, cleaning dishwaters and makers are all have many parts that are susceptible to wear and tear, so keep a cautious watch on older designs. The 2 greatest perpetrators for water damage in homes are cleaning machines and hot water tanks.<p>
