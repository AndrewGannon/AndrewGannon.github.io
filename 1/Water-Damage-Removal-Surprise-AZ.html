Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying because the leak began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
