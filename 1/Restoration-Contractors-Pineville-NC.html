Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas starts next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are utilized on any hard surfaces to eliminate the mold from the surface area.
