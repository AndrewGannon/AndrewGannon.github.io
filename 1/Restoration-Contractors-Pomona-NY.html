<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth discovering. When the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
