<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any adjustments.</p>
