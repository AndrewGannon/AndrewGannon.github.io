Examples of Classification 3 water can include, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite noticeable content or color; all forms of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and rising water from rivers or streams; and other contaminated water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from cyclones, hurricanes, or other weather related events.
