<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is among the most disastrous things that can happen to a person or a household. Molds can be found in many different kinds; in truth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are most likely tens of thousands of types of molds, if not more. Molds play an important function in breaking down plants, trees and leaves. While many molds are harmless, harmful types in enclosed places can cause breathing distress, manifesting itself in symptoms that include stuffy noses and wheezing. The impacts will be more extreme for those who dislike that mold or have asthma. Molds responsible for breaking down natural materials, like wood and leaves, can damage the structure of your home.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
