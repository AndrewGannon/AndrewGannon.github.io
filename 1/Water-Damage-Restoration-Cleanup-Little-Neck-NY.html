<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the steady and slow deterioration of products (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electricity, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reputable timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts typically begin wearing away instantly after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
