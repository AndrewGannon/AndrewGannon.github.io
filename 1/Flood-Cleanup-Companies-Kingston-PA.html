<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and pour over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that wipe it away with a moist towel. Just like a few of the above approaches, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
