Did you know that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
