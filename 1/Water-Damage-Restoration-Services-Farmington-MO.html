While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this suggests that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
