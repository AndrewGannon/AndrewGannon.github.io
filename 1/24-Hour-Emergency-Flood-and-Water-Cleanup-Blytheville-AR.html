<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be hazardous to your health, mainly causing respiratory issues. But in severe cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can cause pneumonia. When you suspect a mold intrusion, you might wish to purchase a mold screening package to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and hire a specialist to aid with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home remedies (made with things you likely already have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache because the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to droop before drying, fixing it may just require pushing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
