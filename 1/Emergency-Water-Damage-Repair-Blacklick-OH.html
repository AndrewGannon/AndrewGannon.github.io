Water damage, water invasion, building envelope issues, and building defects are a very severe matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing many issues due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, houses, condominiums, townhomes, hotels, business structures are specifically susceptible to these problems as generally the builder farms out the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, for that reason leading to expenses and corners being cut.</p>
