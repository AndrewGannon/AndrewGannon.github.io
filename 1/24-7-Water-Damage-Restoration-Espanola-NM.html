<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
