<h3>Water Damage Restorers Palatine IL 60074</h3>
<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can frequently let in rain during the cooler months which can permeate through the walls. With time, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  area.<p>
