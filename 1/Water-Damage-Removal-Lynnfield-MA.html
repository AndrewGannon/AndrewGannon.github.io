<p>Since common structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>Mold can be discovered almost anywhere you turn. They grow on practically any natural substance as long as moisture and oxygen exist. Mold can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation. When extreme moisture collects in your home or workplace mold development will often occur, especially if the moisture problem remains unaddressed or undiscovered.

If the mold is considered to have actually come from water damage, some insurance companies might make you file a 2nd claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation occurs.</p>
