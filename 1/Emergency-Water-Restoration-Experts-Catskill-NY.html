<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Catskill</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health risk and must be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
