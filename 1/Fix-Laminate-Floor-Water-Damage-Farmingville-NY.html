<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
