<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Georgetown</h3>

If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and need to be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
