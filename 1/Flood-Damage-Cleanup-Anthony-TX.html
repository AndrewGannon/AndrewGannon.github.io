<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most destructive things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being completely changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard might need fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor may need changing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you might have identifies and limits the type of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader range of options to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This type of flooring can also have replacements for individual slabs. The best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
