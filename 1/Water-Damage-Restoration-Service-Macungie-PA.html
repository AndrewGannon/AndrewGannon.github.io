Emergency Restoration Services, LLC will evaluate the extent of the damage to your residential or commercial property and will try to conserve as a number of your home and personal possessions such as appliances, furniture, and clothes as we can.

<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in difficult to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more effective when drying under carpet and padding.

In addition to axial fans, an adequate number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep photos of the water damage and all documents associated with the damage and your claim in the event mold grows in the future.

If the mold is considered to have actually come from water damage, some insurance companies might make you submit a 2nd claim of water damage instead, requiring you to pay another deductible before remediation takes place.</p>
