<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Anderson</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp.

This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
