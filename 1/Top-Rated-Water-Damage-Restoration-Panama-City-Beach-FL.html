<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too.

Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
