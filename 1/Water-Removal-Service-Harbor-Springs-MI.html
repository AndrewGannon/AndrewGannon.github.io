<h3>Why You Should Hire Harbor Springs Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health risk and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
