<p>Use a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it could unintentionally push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You might try vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was entirely submerged. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is necessary to prevent recontamination. You need to seal and instantly dispose of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, wash your clothes in hot water, and shower to remove spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
