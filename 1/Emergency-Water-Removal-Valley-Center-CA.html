<p>Unfortunately, however, using bleach is just effective if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, tubs, glass and counter tops. Bleach can not permeate into porous materials and so it does not enter contact with mold growing beneath the surface of materials such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface area however the roots within the material will remain and the mold will soon return.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By lowering the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this assists enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
