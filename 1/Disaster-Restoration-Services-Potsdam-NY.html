<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore security, and cover hands, arms and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the musty areas, in addition to any surrounding areas. If you use bleach, ensure it won't blemish the material or surface area. Location all sponges, devices and other products used in cleaning in a strong garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a close-by exit instead of the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
