Several hundred lawsuits filed in the last five years declare that most of these homes include dozens of infractions of the state-mandated building regulations that eventually enabled water to drain pipes into both new and renovated houses. Many houses with water damage absence basic weatherproofing materials, evaluation reports state. Coats of stucco are typically too thin.
