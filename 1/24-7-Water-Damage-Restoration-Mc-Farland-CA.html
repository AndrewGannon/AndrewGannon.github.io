<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can occur to an individual or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being totally replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may require repairing, if there is minor damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might require replacing and often even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood floor covering you might have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a wider series of choices to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for private slabs. The best method to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
