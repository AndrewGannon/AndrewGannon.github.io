<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially check for any security dangers, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted space entry. We then extract standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment.
