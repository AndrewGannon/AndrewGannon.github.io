<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Southborough</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health danger and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
