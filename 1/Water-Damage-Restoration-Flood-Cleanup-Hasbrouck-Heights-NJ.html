<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and irritation, particularly if you have actually never done it before. Mold requires simply three things to survive and grow: darkness, humidity and wetness. The most common areas in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The very best method to prevent mold growth is to eliminate water leakages or wetness in your home. See our short article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention ideas.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, destructive chemical.

For these factors try to avoid using bleach and if you need to utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
