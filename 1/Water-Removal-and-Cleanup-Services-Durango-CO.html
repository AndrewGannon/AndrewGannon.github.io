<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show noticeable signs of moisture, dripping water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may droop or fall apart under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you may see little indications like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand in time.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most regularly. Despite the area or level of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or comparable devices that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard home fans are not capable of moving a sufficient quantity of air needed to dry a space properly.</p>

Testing for mold might cost just $20 for a home package or as much as $500 for professional testing. Bear in mind, however, that it is frequently baseless, as many remediation services will proceed the very same way regardless of what type of mold is found in your home.</p>
