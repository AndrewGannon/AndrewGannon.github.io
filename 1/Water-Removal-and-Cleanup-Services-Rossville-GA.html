Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
