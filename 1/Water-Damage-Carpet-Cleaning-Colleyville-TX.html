<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for each two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days.
