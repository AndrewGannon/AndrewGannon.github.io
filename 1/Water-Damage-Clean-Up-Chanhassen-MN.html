<h3>Water & Fire Damage Repair‎ in Chanhassen</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health threat and should be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Flooding and other water damage can be unexpected, damaging your property. The excess water can trigger health threats and create structural damage if left unattended.
