<p>Examine the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. They may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion if drywall panels only reveal water stains but aren't structurally compromised. When cutting out around the damaged location, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
