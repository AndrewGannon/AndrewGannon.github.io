<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season.
