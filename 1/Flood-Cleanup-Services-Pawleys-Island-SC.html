<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling due to the fact that of a leaky roof, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and aggravation, specifically if you have actually never ever done it in the past. Mold needs simply 3 things to grow and survive: humidity, wetness and darkness. The most common locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The very best method to avoid mold development is to eliminate water leakages or wetness in your home. See our post, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold avoidance ideas.</p>

Each of these needs different tools and techniques to repair the damage or get rid of.</p>

<p>Damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches might require a complete replacement panel set up since big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends upon where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For example, if the area where you eliminated the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
