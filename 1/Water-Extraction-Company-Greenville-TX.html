<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floors and walls is another possible result of water damage. Walls and floor covering may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the degree of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
