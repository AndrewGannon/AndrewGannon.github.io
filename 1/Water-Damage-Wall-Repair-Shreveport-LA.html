<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
