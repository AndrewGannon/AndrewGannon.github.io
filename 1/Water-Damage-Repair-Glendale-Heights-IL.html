In 2014 we opened SERVPRO of West Sioux Falls to carry out that objective and address the questions of the unknown.</p>
<p>They called me morning and asked me for help. I got here to access the circumstance and found the water was going through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was damaged.
