<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is among the most terrible things that can occur to an individual or a household. Molds comes in various forms; in fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are most likely tens of countless kinds of molds, if not more. Molds play an essential role in breaking down trees, plants and leaves. While many molds are harmless, hazardous types in enclosed locations can lead to respiratory distress, manifesting itself in symptoms that include stuffy noses and wheezing.

Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
