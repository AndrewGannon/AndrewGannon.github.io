<p>You want to address restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to lift and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Use a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it might unintentionally push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You may try vacuuming around the phone's fractures and openings to draw more water out if the phone was totally submerged. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is vital to prevent recontamination. You need to seal and right away get rid of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you wore while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
