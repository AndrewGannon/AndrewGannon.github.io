<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
