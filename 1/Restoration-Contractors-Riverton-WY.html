<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very costly paperweight.</p>
