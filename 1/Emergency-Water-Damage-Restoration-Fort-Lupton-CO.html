<h2>Choosing The Right Water Damage Restoration Service in Fort Lupton</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache due to the fact that the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag prior to drying out, repairing it may simply need pushing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
