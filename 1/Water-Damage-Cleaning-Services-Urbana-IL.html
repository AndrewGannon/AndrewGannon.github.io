After all, there may be absolutely nothing more than staining visible on the surface area but what hides below could be something far worse than a stain. Cleaning the visible side of a wall surface area may not provide real mold removal.</p>

Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
