<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.
