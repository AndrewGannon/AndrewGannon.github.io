<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
