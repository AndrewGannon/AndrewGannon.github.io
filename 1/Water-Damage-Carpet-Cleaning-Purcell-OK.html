<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
