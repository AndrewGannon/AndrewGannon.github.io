<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we initially check for any safety risks, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for restricted space entry.

We will also check vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
