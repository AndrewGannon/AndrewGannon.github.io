Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
