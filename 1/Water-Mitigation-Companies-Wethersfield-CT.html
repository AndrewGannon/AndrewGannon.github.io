<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
