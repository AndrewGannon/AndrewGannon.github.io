<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
