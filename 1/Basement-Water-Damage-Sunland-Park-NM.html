<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another potential result of water damage. Walls and flooring may require replacement or refinishing depending upon the degree of damage. Musty smells can stick around in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, but to add some clarity to the problem of mold, mold spores are dangerous. They are dangerous whether alive or dead. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning. Often, mold spores can be gotten rid of rather quickly from surface areas. But a stain can remain. An all-encompassing mold remediation and stain removal must be performed to guarantee a safe, indoor air environment.</p>
