While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
