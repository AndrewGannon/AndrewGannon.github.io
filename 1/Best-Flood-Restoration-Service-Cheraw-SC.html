<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Typically, indoor air levels of Stachybotrys are low. Similar to other kinds of mold, at higher levels adverse health impacts might take place. These include cold-like symptoms, rashes, sinus inflammation, eye inflammation and irritation of asthma. Some symptoms are more basic - such as inability to focus or fatigue. Generally, symptoms disappear after the mold is gotten rid of. Mitigation is considered an emergency service. Water has the devastating propensity to cause prevalent damage to products that absorb it. Consequently, water mitigators understand the value of a fast reaction. In general, the time it requires to alleviate a property depends upon how extreme the water damage is.<p>
