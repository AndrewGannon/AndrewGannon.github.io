<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration in Kearneysville</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and need to be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
