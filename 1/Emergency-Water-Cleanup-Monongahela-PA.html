<p>It's a stressful situation when water floods your floorings, soaks into your walls, and damages your furniture. Given that a carpet cleaner can just do so much, you need a water damage cleanup group that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) soak up wetness like a sponge.

Some desiccants change color to indicate they are saturated, which can take weeks or days, depending upon how much wetness items include.<p>
