Did you know that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
