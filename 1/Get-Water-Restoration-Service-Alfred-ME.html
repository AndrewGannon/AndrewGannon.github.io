<h2>Flood Restoration Tips in Alfred: What to Do After a Storm</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also gives off severe fumes and it even produces hazardous gas. There are more secure alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce hazardous fumes or leave behind harmful residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent utilizing bleach and if you should use it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
