These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout several days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
