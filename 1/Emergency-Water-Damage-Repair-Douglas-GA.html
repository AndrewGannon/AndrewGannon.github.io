Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across wet surface areas, vaporizing moisture into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an adequate variety of centrifugal fans are chosen.</p>

<p>BRAVO - task well done! Found a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had been over streaming a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours. Called Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were set up, heating pads were put on hardwood floors, ceilings and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes set up. Outstanding, professional care. Very pleased with their quick delivery of emergency service AND their attention to information to ensure the water damage was dried completely.</p>
