<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable indications of moisture, dripping water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you might see little signs like coffee-colored stains that might expand in time.</p>
<p>The most important element of treating drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most often when damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation. No matter the place or degree of the damage, we advise using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or comparable devices that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard home fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient quantity of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>
