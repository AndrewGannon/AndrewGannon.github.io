<h3>Water Damage And Restoration Batesburg SC 29006</h3>
<p>Mold likes to grow in your home's attic and crawl spaces, but what brought the mold in the very first place? The brief answer: darkness and the presence of wetness in the environment. Stone floorings require less time to replace than water damaged hardwood floors. A complete floor replacement can be expected to be completed in four to ten days. Water damaged walls typically peel and might need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs several hours.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to get the job done appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
