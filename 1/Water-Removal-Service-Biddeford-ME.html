Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season.
