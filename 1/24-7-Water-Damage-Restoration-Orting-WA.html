<p>Cladosporium: This mold may be green or black. (Though it is black in color, it is not the same as black mold.) It grows on the backs of toilets and painted surface areas and in fiberglass air ducts. The damage restoration process addresses the damage brought on by a fire in your house or company premises. We bring back regular living conditions to get you back to typical as rapidly as possible.

<p>Note: While many experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, listed below 50% is best for controlling both mold growth and allergen.
