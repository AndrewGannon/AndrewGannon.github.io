<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Now that you can recognize when water damage is covered by your property owner's insurance, it's essential that you to contact your insurance company as soon as possible when you find water damage in your house. You should take images of the affected area and whatever that was damaged, along with where the water came from, such as the burst pipe or Leaking roof and home insurance.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
