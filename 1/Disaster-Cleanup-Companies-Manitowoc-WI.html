In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
