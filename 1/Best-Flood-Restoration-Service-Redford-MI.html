<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
