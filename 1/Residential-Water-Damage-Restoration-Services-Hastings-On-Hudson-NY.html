<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
