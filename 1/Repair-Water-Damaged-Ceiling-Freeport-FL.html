<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green).

Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate amount of air required to dry a space adequately.</p>
