<p>Rust is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and gradual deterioration of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you integrate electricity, metal, water and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no reliable timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components generally begin corroding immediately after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of a problem. How quick the corrosion process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
