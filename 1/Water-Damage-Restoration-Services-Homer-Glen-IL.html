As soon as MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure.
