Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components.

If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
