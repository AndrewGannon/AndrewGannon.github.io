<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may need fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may need replacing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The type of wood floor covering you might have identifies and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a wider range of alternatives to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for specific slabs. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>

We also set up portable heating fans to accelerate the drying process.</p>
