They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
