<p>Recent Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Scrub mold off tough surface areas with detergent and water, and dry entirely. The most typical form of damage, especially if the dripping water heater isn't fixed in a prompt way, is mold and mildew. Mold can be particularly dangerous to specific people and must be treated quickly. For example, after a fire is extinguished your worries are still not over because ash, soot, and water remains. We want you to know that we have your back.<p>
