<p>Any structure that has actually suffered from water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Use a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore protection, and cover arms, legs and hands to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the musty area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the occurrence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize industrial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the moldy areas, in addition to any surrounding locations. Make sure it won't stain the material or surface area if you use bleach. Place all sponges, devices and other products utilized in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a nearby exit as opposed to the primary house, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
