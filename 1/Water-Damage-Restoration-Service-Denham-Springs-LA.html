<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his guys were amazing in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
