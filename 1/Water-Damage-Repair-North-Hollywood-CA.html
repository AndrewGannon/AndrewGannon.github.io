<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any situation, especially when the water heater unit is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater is imminent unless repaired quickly, and the costs increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
