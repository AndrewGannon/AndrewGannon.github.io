<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>Utilizing bleach or other chemicals to kill indoor mold development is not needed most of the times. The goal should be to remove mold development by cleaning or getting rid of moldy products.

Do not mix bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, due to the fact that an unsafe chlorine gas may be formed.</p>
