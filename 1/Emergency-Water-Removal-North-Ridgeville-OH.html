<p>Mold likes to grow in your house's attic and crawl spaces, however what brought the mold in the first place? The brief answer: darkness and the existence of moisture in the environment. Stone floorings require less time to replace than water damaged hardwood floors. A total floor replacement can be expected to be ended up in 4 to 10 days. Water damaged walls typically peel and may require both repair and repainting; the latter service requires several hours.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
