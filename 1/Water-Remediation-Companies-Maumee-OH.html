<p>Due to the fact that the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water, getting it damp can turn into a significant headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag before drying out, repairing it may just require pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
