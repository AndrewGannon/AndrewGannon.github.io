<h2>Main Causes of Home Water Damage in Carmichael</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can happen on its own if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This sort of dehumidifier produces the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in wetness through chemical attraction instead of condensation to eliminate water from the air. A desiccant is a material that draws in and holds moisture. This material acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated exhaust air, the moisture evaporates (desorption) and is brought outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
