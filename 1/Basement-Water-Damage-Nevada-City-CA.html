<p>They called me morning and asked me for assistance. I got here to access the situation and found the water was running through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was destroyed. To add to the problem, we had insulated all the floorings and interior walls for sound absorption. All had to be eliminated and re-installed throughout the home. We likewise set up portable heating fans to speed up the drying process.</p>

<p>Also, because bleach is primarily water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily taken in by the material. So, while you may have rubbed out or stained the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually provided a lot of water to regrow and perhaps spread the mold beneath the surface area. If there is a lot of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  variations of these and other guidance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
