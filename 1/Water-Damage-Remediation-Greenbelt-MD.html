These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
