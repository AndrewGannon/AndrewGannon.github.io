<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was basic: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege came from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little federal government and home builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much higher.</p>

<p>One reason is that bleach can not entirely eliminate mold growing in porous materials. The chlorine in bleach can not permeate into porous surfaces such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface of porous products and just the water component of the bleach is soaked up into the product, offering more moisture for the mold to eat. Final Fixes: The final actions of the fire damage restoration project are the conclusion of repairs. Generally, repairs include the replacement of materials, painting, and any other repair services that will be needed to bring back the home or business to its pre-loss condition.<p>
