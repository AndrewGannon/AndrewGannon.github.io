<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
