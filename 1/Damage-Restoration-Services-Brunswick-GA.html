<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
