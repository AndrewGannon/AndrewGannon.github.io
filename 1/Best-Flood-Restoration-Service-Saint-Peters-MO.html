<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a wet towel. As with some of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and remember that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be gotten rid of and replaced. If basement carpet has actually become moldy, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to remove wetness if it's attached to the floor.</p>
