<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

Fans will blow air throughout the surface and trigger the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it will not kick back into the product and trigger additional damage to the space.<p>
