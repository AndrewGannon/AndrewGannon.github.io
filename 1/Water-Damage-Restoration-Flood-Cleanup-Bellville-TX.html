Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally acknowledged expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to confirm and check the new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial consumers that, unlike any other technique or device, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
