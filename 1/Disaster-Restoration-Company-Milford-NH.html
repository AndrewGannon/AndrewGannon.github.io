<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
